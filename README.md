# Dracula-shell-40
Customized dark theme based on @dracula for the new gnome-shell 40

## Install

To install just move to your current theme: **(Remember to save a backup of your theme)**

```console
user@host:~$ cp ./gnome-shell.css ~/.themes/<your theme>/gnome-shell/gnome-shell.css
```

## Others

My personal recommendation is to use the Dracula theme for GTK; )
